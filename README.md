### One-time run codes (no toggle) ###
- Clone Pokemon from Box 1 Slot 1 to:
    + Box 1 Slot 2
    + Slots 2 thru 12
    + Slots 2 thru 30 (fill the entire box)
- Box 1 Slot 1 modifiers:
    + Make Pokemon shiny
    + Rename Egg with its Shiny Value (ESV).  Renamed eggs *should* be tradeable online, since I've been able to trade custom-named eggs to people.
    + Change name of Pokemon to the OT's Secret ID (SID).  This can be used to calculate someone's Trainer Shiny Value (TSV).
        + Go here to calculate someone's TSV using their TID and SID: http://tomatoland.org/dada/pkmn/sv/
        + Also, do NOT use this on a Pokemon if you don't have clones of it!
    + Change name of Pokemon to its Encryption Constant.  This isn't that useful, but it lets you check a cloned Pokemon's encryption key without having to use a save editor like PKHeX.
        + Again, be careful when using code like this!  Make sure you clone the Pokemon before you use this code on it!

### Toggle codes ###
- Encounter modifiers:
    + Make the encounter shiny (finally working!)

Currently, that's the only toggle code that I put into this plugin.  More coming soon?

This plugin works with online play, too!  Now you can clone Pokemon and Wonder Trade without exiting the game!  Special thanks to Nanquitas for making the online compatibility possible?

NOTE: I'm not exactly sure that all the codes will work for X/Y, since I just updated it for X/Y support.  (Crossing my fingers!)
